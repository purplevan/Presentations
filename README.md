# Presentations
In this repo are slides from presentations I have given at events such as conferences, talks, etc.

The Cybersecurity Roles teaching slides are something I presented to interns at H2L to help them understand the wide field of cybersecurity and to see all of the options out there for careers.

The SMD one is from the 2022 Space and Missile Defense Symposium in Huntsville, AL on "Creating a Risk Managed and Threat-Informed Cyber Defense Strategy." The slides that include "demo" in the title were demos/examples performed live and can be ignored in the pdf version of the slides. 

The DC3 one is from a 2022 DC3/DCISE TechEx in Mclean, VA. It is the same presentation as the SMD one, however a few edits were made for improvement. A slide on cloud mappings to TTPs (pg 14) and a CALDERA demo (pg 18) were added. If you would like the ppt version with demo videos included, message me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/micah-vanfossen

The Purple Team presentation is from the 2024 National Cyber Summit in Huntsville, AL. My goal for this presentation was to display that by utilizing the threat-informed defense principles of cyber threat intelligence, defensive countermeasures, and testing and evaluation, an organization of any size can start a purple team program that is able to scout, prepare, and react to adversaries in a proactive approach.
