# Presentations
In this repo are slides from presentations I have given at events such as conferences, talks, etc.

The first is from the 2022 Space and Missile Defense Symposium on "Creating a Risk Managed and Threat-Informed Cyber Defense Strategy." The slides that include "demo" in the title wer demos/examples performed live and can be ignored in the pdf version of the slides.
